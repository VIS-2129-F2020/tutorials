```

## Load libraries

```{r}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Load data in 3 formats

```{r read shapefile}

exercise_shp <- st_read(
  "data-downloads/Parks_and_Recreation-shp/Parks_and_Recreation.shp")

```

```{r read geojson}

exercise_geojson <- st_read("data-downloads/Parks_and_Recreation.geojson")

```

```{r read KML}

exercise_kml <- st_read("data-downloads/Parks_and_Recreation.kml")

```

## Transform coordinate system
```{r transform}
Irish_nat_grid <- "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=1.000035 +x_0=200000 +y_0=250000 +a=6377340.189 +b=6356034.447938534 +units=m +no_defs"

exercise_nat_grid <- exercise_geojson %>%
  st_transform(crs = Irish_nat_grid)

```


## Save as a shapefile

```{r save as shapefile}

st_write(exercise_nat_grid, "exercise_nat_grid.shp")

```
