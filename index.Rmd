For each week's assignment, I've posted (or will have posted) one or more video tutorials and a written tutorial here. Since R is a script-based program, the written tutorials will often be sufficient for assignments that will be completed in R (most assignments), but the video tutorials may be useful to you as you begin to familiarize yourself with the RStudio interface.

## Week 2: Relationships and distributions
